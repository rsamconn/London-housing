# London-housing
Applying some simple ML models while learning about housing data in London.

## To do
1. Choose a dateset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=london+hous)
2. EDA
3. Initial ML analysis - test some KNNs for fun
4. Main ML analysis - find the best regression model and optimize it

## Goals
Learn about housing data:
- Best price predictors
- Average price by no. of bedrooms by borough
- Price change over time

ML models to use:
- scikit-learn supervised ML models
- KNN, regression (linear, logistic, Lasso, Ridge)
- Try feature selection with Lasso regression
